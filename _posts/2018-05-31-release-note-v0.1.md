Filestash has brought org mode out of emacs:

Filestash v0.1 release brought a lot of the sweetness that makes org mode awesome without denaturing it or trying to reinvent it but rather by making it available to any touch based devices:
- todolist: supports for tags with inheritance, checkbox, priority and more
- agenda: supporting everything from the todolist + recurrent event
- toggle button: fold headlines
- text interaction with:
  - link: navigate to another org doc or website
  - image: brings a preview
  - line number: toggles the element in this line
  - todo keyword: toggles the state of your todo
  - the "*" char in the title: toggle the headline 
  - checkbox: toggles it
  - priority: change the priority
