    <h2 style="margin-top:0;">Creating an awesome Web FTP client</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional FTP clients such as <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">Filezilla FTP</a> or <a href="https://winscp.net/eng/index.php">WinSCP</a> are great for sysadmin, but having access to all the feature from the FTP protocols makes it hard to use for everyone else. The value proposition of Filestash is to make FTP <strong>easy to use</strong> for the <strong>end-users</strong>, not sys admins, bringing collaboration features to make FTP a modern replacement to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/17/edward-snowden-dropbox-privacy-spideroak">Dropbox that respect your privacy</a>

    <h3>What does FTP stand for?</h3>
    <p>
      FTP stands for "File Transfer Protocol"
    </p>
    <h3>What is the FTP Protocol?</h3>
    <p>
      FTP is a protocol that defines how two machines (known as the client and the server) can communicate over a network to transfer files. It has been defined in many different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol#History_of_FTP_servers">RFCs</a>
    </p>
    <h3>What is FTP used for?</h3>
    <p>
      FTP is used to transfer files over a network
    </p>
    <h3>What is a FTP server?</h3>
    <p>
      An FTP server is a server software that implements the FTP protocol (example: <a href="https://www.pureftpd.org/project/pure-ftpd/">PureFTPd</a>, <a href="http://bftpd.sourceforge.net/">bftpd</a>, <a href="http://proftpd.org/">proFTPd</a>, <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=server">Filezilla server</a>, ...). It is used to enable the sharing of files between different parties over a network.
    </p>
    <h3>What is a FTP client?</h3>
    <p>
      An FTP client is a software that can be used to access an FTP server. Example: <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">Filezilla FTP</a>, <a href="{% post_url 2019-11-26-ftp-web-client %}">Filestash</a>, <a href="https://cyberduck.io/">Cyberduck</a>, ...
    </p>
    <h3>Who invented FTP?</h3>
    <p>
      FTP was invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhay_Bhushan">Abhay Bhushan</a> while he was a student at MIT.
    </p>
    <h3>When was FTP invented?</h3>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc114">original specification of FTP</a> was published the 16 April 1971 and was revisited several times in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s.
    </p>
    <h3>What does FTP do?</h3>
    <p>
      FTP is a means by which two machines can transfer files over a network.
    </p>
    <h3>Is FTP dead?</h3>
    <p>
      No, FTP is alive and well. If we account only for the visible side of the iceberg, there are about as many FTP servers exposed to the internet as the entire population of Switzerland.
    </p>
    <h3>Is FTP unsecure?</h3>
    <p>
      While it is true that FTP wasn't initially created with security in mind, the protocol got refined in 2005 to support TLS with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4217">RFC4217</a>

    </p>
    <h3>Is FTP bulky?</h3>
    <p>
      No. In fact, FTP was created at a time where nobody could afford the hardware to run anything bulky.
    </p>
    <h3>Is FTP hard to use?</h3>
    <p>
      Not necessarily. FTP is a protocol, not an end-user application. On the many software available for FTP, some are harder to use than other ones. <a href="{% post_url 2019-11-26-ftp-web-client %}">Filestash</a> is quite easy to use
    </p>
