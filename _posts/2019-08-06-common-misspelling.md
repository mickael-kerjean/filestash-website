Filestash is a contraction of "Files" and "stash" and is often misspelled **stashapp** or **stash app** and even **file stash** or **stash** and **stach**. At its root it's an open source web app that lets you manage your data wherever this data is located. Pick your poison from a FTP server to an SFTP server, a Webdav server or a whole range of other protocols/platforms and this is it, you now have an easy to use platform a la Dropbox:
