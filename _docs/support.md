By becoming a customer, you're not just receiving a bespoke solution tailored to your needs, you're also fueling our mission to make Filestash a superior alternative to Dropbox and Google Drive.

To give you peace of mind, we offer solid service level agreements (SLAs), access to a broader range of plugins, and extensive customization options, including corporate branding and white labeling. Essentially, we're equipped to support all your enterprise needs.

Upon onboarding, you'll unlock access to our dedicated [customer platform](https://platform.filestash.app). Itâ€™s designed to handle everything from support queries to one-on-one sessions with the lead developer for solving any issues you might have, as well as retrieving invoices, requesting custom builds, and more:
